I am a fourth year PhD candidate in psychology at UC Berkeley under the supervision of Alison Gopnik. I'm interested in the cognitive mechanisms underlying different kinds of non-literal language, such as metaphors and metonyms. More broadly, I'm also interested in children's acquisition of symbolic systems, such as language and pictorial representations.

Before starting graduate school, I worked as a lab manager with Susan Carey at the Harvard Lab for Developmental Studies. I received a B.Sc. in English and Psychology from the University of Toronto.
